    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and how software can solve real-world problems. 
        The ability to build something from scratch and see it come to life excites me. 
        As a developer, I love the continuous learning process, the problem-solving challenges, 
        and the opportunity to create impactful applications that make people's lives easier. 
        Software development is a field that allows me to be both creative and analytical, 
        and that is what truly drives my passion for coding.
